## Inspiration
In our everyday lives, we are so focused on our own problems that we fail to notice nature in all its diversity. The weed on your doorstep? You walk past it without seeing the fascinating mechanism it uses to spread its seeds. The birds by the lake that pass by once a year? You ignore them, unaware that they have traveled hundreds of miles without pause. 
By documenting your encounters with nature, you become aware of how complex and fascinating it is. A first step that will surely trigger actions to protect nature.

## What it does
The app allows you to save encounters with animals or plants in the form of an entry. These are then saved in one of the following categories:
mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibias, brids, insects, trees, shrubs, flowers, grasses, fruits/vegetables

The user has the option to enter photos, the name, the genus/family and a description of the object. On the start page, the most recent entry is displayed, as well as statistics with how many entries per category the user has entered.
